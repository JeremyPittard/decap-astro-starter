Investor Mindset

Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah., This is a consular ship.



I can see one of them now. Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly.



The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something.



Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas. Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up. Who do you think.



Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be. What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will. All right, kid.



Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.



You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once.



This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.



Fear of this battle station. And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.



I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that. What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to your vaporators.



This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you.



That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. Going somewhere, Solo? Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. It's too late.



Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to kill her! Better her than me. She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be. What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will.



According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned. Did you find any droids? No, sir.



Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don't underestimate the power of the Force.
